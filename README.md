# C_Sharp

Currently in my role as a Software Engineering Intern at HE, I am starting a project called "Registration Portal Rebuild." For that, I have to learn C# and .NET.

This repo contains all the resources, concepts, and code one may need to understand and implement c# and .NET using Visual Studio.

### Resources

1. [Prog. with Mosh Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&list=PLTjRvDozrdlz3_FPXwb6lX_HoGXa09Yef)
2. [Visual Studio 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcU2HGsxeII)

### Downloads and Installation

Visual Studio 2022



### Concepts

C# developers borrowed ideas from the JAVA community. In JAVA, the compiler does not directly translate into machine code but into an intermediate language called bytecode. In C# it's IL code and then it's turned into Native code. The CLR translates the IL code into Native code. This process is called JIT (Just in time compilation)

- Setting up the folders and files:

You would typically start by setting up your Program.cs to configure and run your ASP.NET Core application. Then, you would define your models (like WeatherForecast.cs) to represent the data your application will work with. Next, you would write services (inside the Services folder) to implement your business logic and controllers (inside the Controllers folder) to handle HTTP requests and call your services. Configuration settings would be placed in appsettings.json, and if you're connecting to external services, you'd configure them in the Connected Services folder. The Dockerfile is used to containerize your application for deployment, and Properties/launchSettings.json is used to configure how your application runs in different environments. Dependencies are managed through your csproj file or the NuGet Package Manager.
